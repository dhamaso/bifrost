jQuery Bifröst
==============

A [jQuery Ajax transport] (http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajaxTransport) that uses
the *hidden IFrame technique* to make asynchronous requests, allowing to send
both files and data even from browsers that do not natively support Ajax.

The name is an analogy to the Norse mythology where Bifröst is the magic
bridge between Midgard (abode of mankind) and Asgard, the realm of the gods.
